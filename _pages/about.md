I am a Staff Systems Research Scientist at IP, Design and Platform Research (IDP) at Intel Labs. My current research interests lie in exploring agile software-hardware co-design approaches in building domain specific accelerators. During this reseach endeavor across different projects, I have earlier worked on the open-source DNN compiler stack [TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/) as part of building an inference accelerator based on the [VTA](https://tvm.apache.org/vta) architecture and on software/compiler stack for other domain specific accelerators. In an earlier role at Intel, I worked on developing a disruptive stress testing methodology for significantly improving the manufacturing efficiency of ICs fabricated on advanced Intel process nodes.

I received my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2018, working with [Dr. Abhijit Chatterjee](https://research.gatech.edu/abhijit-chatterjee). My thesis focused on building error-resilient cyber-physical systems and circuits by developing machine learning inspired error compensation algorithms. 

Prior to my PhD, I received my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Tech in 2014 with a minor in mathematics. In summers of 2014 and 2015, I interned in Intel Labs at Santa Clara, California where I developed stress testing algorithms for analog and mixed-signal circuits.

Before coming to the US in 2012, I completed my BE in Electrical Engineering from [Jadavpur University, India](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/) in 2011. During my undergraduate research, I worked on developing adaptive control algorithms for state-space control systems using different bio-inspired algorithms.
